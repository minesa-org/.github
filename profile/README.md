# Welcome to Minesa Hub! 👐🏻

> _This project is a fan remake of Dungeon Blitz, developed by Neodevils & Tommy under the Minesa Studios initiative._
> _All development, discussion and roadmap are coordinated via the official Minesa Discord._


Hey! We’re Minesa Hub, and we’re bringing *Dungeon Blitz* back to life — right in your browser. No waiting around, no red tape. We’re rebuilding the whole thing from scratch, using **pure C++**, no engines, just solid code and stubborn passion.

- **What we’re doing now:** Making the original game playable 
- **What’s next:** A full remake, built from the ground up in C++


## Who’s behind all this?

- **Neo** – Leads the project and keeps everything on track  
- **Tommy** – Our lead dev, the guy making the magic actually happen
- **Frosby** — An awesome guy doing works on Flash-reboot


We’re pumped to get this back into players’ hands. Stick around — we’ll have more to share soon.
